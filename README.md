# face-classification
This repository contains the code and resources for a robust face classification system developed using the DeepFace library in Python. The system is powered by a pre-trained VGG-Face model, enabling accurate identification of individuals in images.

Key Features:

Utilizes cutting-edge Deep Learning techniques for facial classification.
Trained with a diverse dataset and fine-tuned using VGG-Face for top-tier accuracy.
Provides an easy-to-use interface for users to classify individuals in images.
Deployed for real-time classification and continuously improved for better results.
Explore the code, data, and documentation to understand and replicate the project. Feel free to use it for your own face classification tasks or contribute to its further development."
